# Phishing_analysis
In Task 2 of my Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship, I conducted a detailed analysis of a realistic phishing email designed to mimic a trusted brand (PayPal). The goal was to identify common phishing tactics used by attackers to trick users and bypass basic email security measures.
The email exhibited multiple red flags, including:

Spoofed sender domain (e.g., pypal@gmial.com)

Failed SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication

Urgent and threatening language

Mismatched and malicious links

Fake HTML attachment mimicking a login form

Spelling and grammatical errors

Brand impersonation techniques

I documented all findings in a professionally structured PDF report, highlighting how these techniques combine to increase the effectiveness of phishing campaigns. This exercise strengthened my skills in email header analysis, social engineering detection, and security awareness.
